### Local adaptations

Both files retain the upstream client-component directive and animation logic. Props types are exported for reuse.

- `BlurText`: changed the Motion import from `motion/react` to the requested `framer-motion` package; added an optional semantic `as` prop (`span`, `p`, `h1`, `h2`, `h3`); respect reduced-motion preferences by showing the final text without movement; capture the observed element for reliable observer cleanup.
- `Magnet`: preserve the upstream proximity calculation and CSS transform; disable animation for reduced-motion preferences and ignore magnetic pointer tracking on devices without a fine pointer and hover; reset pointer displacement when pointer capabilities change or the window loses focus. The `disabled` prop suppresses transforms immediately.

The components are integrated into the Trullo Natalino website. They are not offered as a standalone component product.

## Additional React Bits components supplied by the user — 2026-10-05

Dock, SpecularButton, DepthCarousel, MaskedHeading and ScrollExpand were supplied as complete React Bits JavaScript + CSS source in the user's attachments. They are integrated into this website under the upstream React Bits license reproduced above; the attachments do not identify an upstream commit for these versions.

Local adaptations:
- All five components are typed in TypeScript and styled with Trullo Natalino's palette.
- Dock preserves proximity magnification and spring sizing; uses the installed Framer Motion package, native links/buttons, top-header tooltips and stable touch controls.
- SpecularButton preserves the supplied OGL fragment shader and pointer-driven specular lighting; adds native anchor support, reduced-motion/WebGL fallback, capped pixel density, offscreen/hidden-tab suspension and GPU cleanup.
- DepthCarousel preserves the GSAP depth-rail positioning and drag navigation; uses local photographs through Next Image, larger indicator hit areas, Italian labels, native page scrolling, initial-photo selection and corrected drag-click suppression.
- MaskedHeading preserves the SVG glyph mask, image drift and wipe reveal; adds Next Image, fallback text and reduced-motion/offscreen suspension.
- ScrollExpand preserves the clip-path expansion, zoom, sticky track and overlay transitions; adds Next Image, responsive framing, a persistent CTA area and a static reduced-motion layout.
- BlurText additionally accepts an animation gate to coordinate with the opening sequence.

The Trullo Natalino SVG mark is a local vector reconstruction of the logo shown in the user's supplied moodboard. The opening sequence follows the public Organiq reference's build → wordmark → progress completion → upward curtain structure, implemented locally without copying its branding or assets.

Additional Trullo Natalino adaptations: Dock renders text-only controls while retaining the proximity spring. BlurText preserves rich text markup, repeats on viewport re-entry, adds scroll-linked exit blur/opacity, and respects reduced motion. Form controls and persistent navigation remain legible during interaction.


## AccordionGallery — source supplied by the user, 2026-10-05

Adapted from the supplied React Bits AccordionGallery (GSAP) under the React Bits license above. Local adaptations: TypeScript, local Next Image assets, native buttons with keyboard focus navigation, responsive vertical mode, automatic progression with pause, offscreen suspension, and reduced motion. The continuous events marquee is a local component.

## Locorotondo photography

All five photographs are attributed individually in public/crediti-fotografici.html and public/images/locorotondo/source.json. Resizing, WebP conversion and display crops retain the respective CC BY-SA 3.0 or 4.0 license. Property and event images were supplied by the user.

## Static location map

The map in `public/maps/trullo-natalino.svg` is locally rendered from © OpenStreetMap contributors data, licensed under ODbL 1.0: https://www.openstreetmap.org/copyright. The geographic extract is included in `scripts/data/location-map.json` under the same ODbL license; regenerate the illustration with `node scripts/generate-location-map.mjs`. The custom trullo marker is placed at the coordinates supplied by the owner (40°45′42.1″N, 17°20′27.1″E). The illustration and trullo marker are local designs, not Google Maps screenshots.

## ScrollStack — source supplied by the user, 2026-10-05

Adapted from the supplied React Bits ScrollStack JavaScript + CSS under the React Bits license reproduced above. Local adaptations: TypeScript, window scrolling, stable untransformed wrapper measurements, section-scoped DOM queries, responsive card heights, ResizeObserver, reduced-motion and short-viewport static layouts, a user-selectable static reading mode, and Lenis lifecycle cleanup/offscreen suspension. Lenis is licensed under MIT; its license is included in node_modules/lenis/LICENSE.
